# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges
- Risk: Riddles being too difficult or too easy
- Mitigation: Start with moderate difficulty, implement hint system, get feedback from beta testers

- Risk: Users getting permanently stuck
- Mitigation: Progressive hint system, optional skip mechanisms after time delays

- Risk: Cheating or answer sharing
- Mitigation: Obfuscated answer storage, unique riddle variations, focus on experience over competition

## MVP Scope Management
- Risk: Feature creep delaying core functionality
- Mitigation: Strict MVP definition focusing on 3-5 core riddles and basic functionality

- Risk: Over-engineering the solution
- Mitigation: Start with simple HTML/CSS/JS, avoid complex frameworks initially

## Resource Constraints
- Risk: Time pressure for wedding date
- Mitigation: Prioritized development phases, MVP-first approach, progressive enhancement

- Risk: Limited testing with actual users
- Mitigation: Self-testing with similar puzzles, simple A/B testing of riddle difficulty
